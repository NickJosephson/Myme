# Myme Vision Statement
<br>
Myme is an app that provides users with a studio, in which they can easily explore, collect, and create memes, tailored to their tastes. Myme allows users to browse existing memes, and gives them the option to make new memes.

This app is designed for users who view memes as a funny side to every conversation. Myme’s users are split into three tiers. The first is a user who simply enjoys viewing memes, and does not interact with them in any other way. The second is a user who shares memes that they like with others, particularly on social media. The third (and highest) tier is a content creator who expresses themselves through the memes they create. Naturally, there exists some overlap between the three user tiers.

Each user tier can view memes through Myme. Users can browse the memes that Myme chooses to present to them or alternatively, users with a specific meme in mind, may choose to search for it within Myme’s meme library.

If a user sees a meme that they like, and may want to revisit it later, they can favourite the meme. The more memes the user favourites, the more Myme learns of the user’s sense of humour. Knowledge of the user’s taste makes it possible for Myme to present memes to a user that are better suited to them, which leads to an improved user experience.

Content creators can use Myme’s meme creator function. This is designed for users who want to express themselves through making memes. Myme will let users put their own spin on existing meme formats, or create a brand new format. Users can share memes that they have created, or ones that they found in Myme’s library.

Myme will improve the user’s experience with memes, for multiple reasons. Myme is envisioned as a mobile app. Part of what Myme offers is a convenient a way to create and edit memes, on the same device that they use to view memes. Making meme creation more accessible means more memes, and that’s good for everyone. Myme is great because it utilizes the ability of memes to be entertaining and to reduce stress. Furthermore, many users save their memes in their primary photo library. Another benefit of Myme is that it offers a library which is external to a device’s main photo library. This will reduce clutter in a user’s primary photo library by giving them an additional, designated library to save their memes. 

Myme will be a success if users find a use for it in their regular life, thus this app’s success is measured by retention. If more than half of each user tier still uses the app weekly, one month after installation, then the app can be considered a success.
